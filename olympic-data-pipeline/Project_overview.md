## Step 1: Project Initiation

**Project Description:** In this project, I will create an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Azure services to process Olympic data from a source, perform data transformations using Apache Spark, store both raw and transformed data in Azure Data Lake Storage, and finally, analyze the data using Azure Synapse Analytics to build a dashboard.

**Define Project Objectives:**
- Extract Olympic data from a source (Kaggle).
- Transform the data using Apache Spark.
- Store raw and transformed data in Azure Data Lake Storage.
- Perform analytics on the data using Azure Synapse Analytics.
- Create a dashboard using Power BI or Tableau.

**Identify Stakeholders:** Project team members, data analysts, data scientists, and business stakeholders.

**Set Project Timeline:** Define project milestones and deadlines.

## Step 2: Data Source Understanding

1. **Gather Information about the Olympic Data:**
   - Access the public GitHub repository containing the raw Olympic data.
   - Clone or download the data repository from GitHub to my local environment.

2. **Understand the Data:**
   - Explore the data structure, columns, and format.
   - Document data source details for reference during the project.

## Step 3: Azure Service Selection

- Identify and choose the Azure services required for each stage of the pipeline:
  - Data Factory for data extraction.
  - Data Lake Storage for data storage.
  - Azure Databricks (Apache Spark) for data transformation.
  - Azure Synapse Analytics for data analytics.
  - Power BI or Tableau for dashboard creation.

## Step 4: Set Up Azure Resources

- Create Azure accounts and necessary resources (Data Factory, Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI/Tableau).

## Step 5: Data Extraction with Azure Data Factory

1. **Configure Azure Data Factory:**
   - Set up Azure Data Factory to extract data from the Kaggle source.

2. **Ensure Raw Data Storage:**
   - Ensure data is stored in a raw format in Azure Data Lake Storage.

## Step 6: Data Transformation with Azure Databricks

1. **Set up Apache Spark Environment:**
   - Configure the Apache Spark environment in Azure Databricks.

2. **Write Transformation Code:**
   - Develop transformation code to clean, preprocess, and enrich the data.

3. **Store Transformed Data:**
   - Store the transformed data in Azure Data Lake Storage.

## Step 7: Data Analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics

1. **Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics:**
   - Employ Azure Synapse Analytics to run SQL queries and perform data analytics.

2. **Create SQL Notebooks:**
   - Develop SQL notebooks for custom analytics queries.


## Step 8: Dashboard Creation

- Choose a dashboarding tool for building interactive dashboards.

## Step 9: Testing and Validation

1. **Data Pipeline Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test the entire data pipeline for data accuracy and completeness.

2. **Dashboard Validation:**
   - Verify that the dashboard accurately reflects the data insights.



This project will result in a fully functional data engineering pipeline that extracts, transforms, stores, analyzes, and visualizes Olympic data, providing valuable insights for decision-making and reporting.
